# team_TFBS.md

This is the home repo for Team Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS). 

## Team Members

- Alex Nakagawa
- Jemima Shi

## Objective 

This team will be concerned with 

1. Mapping all TFBS onto sequence space
2. Visualize TFBS and conservation
3. Make tools for community
4. Implement neural network on TFBS data

## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018` to start.

## To do 

- [ ] Make alignments for all fasta files
- [ ] Make [Map_motif](https://github.com/iamciera/map_motif) a tool that is friendly and usable. 
    -  [ ] Make issues for problems 
    -  [ ] Make clear under python standards
    -  [ ] Make badass visualization
    -  [ ] Find a home for tool once finished and follow those standards
    -  [ ] write documentation
    -  [ ] write tests
-  [ ]  Get data for project: Map TFBS information for across all species
    -  [ ] explore thresholds, how do we automate threshold?
    -  [ ] make sql database?
- [ ] Data Analysis
    - [ ] Figure out questions to ask and how to statistically ask them
    - [ ] Incorporate conservation
    - [ ] Implement in Neural Network

## Platforms

Main language: Python
