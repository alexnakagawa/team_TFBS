# team_TFBS.md

## Team Members

This is the home repo for Team Transcription Binding Site (TFBS). 

## Objective 

This team will be concerned with 

1. Mapping all TFBS onto sequence space
2. Visualize TFBS and conservation
3. Make tools for community
4. Implement neural network on TFBS data

## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018` to start.

## To do 

- [ ] Make alignments for all fasta files
- [ ] Make [Map_motif](https://github.com/iamciera/map_motif) a tool that is friendly and usable. 
    -  [ ] Make issues for problems 
    -  [ ] Make clear under python standards
    -  [ ] Make badass visualization
    -  [ ] Find a home for tool once finished and follow those standards
    -  [ ] write documentation
    -  [ ] write tests
-  [ ]  Get data for project: Map TFBS information for across all species
    -  [ ] explore thresholds, how do we automate threshold?
    -  [ ] make sql database?
- [ ] Data Analysis
    - [ ] Figure out questions to ask and how to statistically ask them
    - [ ] Incorporate conservation
    - [ ] Implement in Neural Network

## Platforms

Main language: Python

## Data Management

1. All output data is kept in `data/output` and tagged with date of creation. 
2. Notes on background are kept in team repo in the wiki
3. Scripts that are run sequentially are numbered accordingly
5. Use underscores for spaces in file and folder naming
6. Keep data over 100MB in [Google Drive DiscoveryDNA_shared_data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X)
7. Update README with vital information about repo or directory
